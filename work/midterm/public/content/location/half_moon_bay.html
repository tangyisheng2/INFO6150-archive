                Half Moon Bay is a coastal city in San Mateo County, California, United States, approximately 25 miles
                (40 km) south of San Francisco. Its population was 11,795 as of the 2020 census. Immediately at the
                north of Half Moon Bay is Pillar Point Harbor and the unincorporated community of Princeton-by-the-Sea.
                Half Moon Bay is known for Mavericks, a big-wave surf location. It is called Half Moon Bay because of
                its crescent shape.

                Originally an agricultural outpost to Mission San Francisco de Asís, the town was found in the 1840s
                first as San Benito, and then as is its Anglo fishing community grew, it was renamed Spanishtown. In
                1874, it was again renamed to Half Moon Bay. After rail and road connections in the early 1900s the town
                grew. The Foggy weather of the coast made the town a popular destination for booze running during
                prohibition.

                The city's infrastructure is heavily integrated with the coast, including the Pillar Point Harbor, major
                roads and fire department. The economy of Half Moon Bay is dominated by a handful of businesses, the
                biggest of which the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay employs 500 people and is a major source of property and
                tourism income for the city.[8] Because of this geography, a 2022 study found that the city had over 123
                buildings vulnerable to sea level rise.[8]
